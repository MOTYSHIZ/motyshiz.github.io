        <p>Most of my projects are on my <a href="https://github.com/MOTYSHIZ">Github</a>, but I will be listing some

        <h3>InVRasion (Working Title)</h3>
        <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-jDV3yzqTzuN2h0cDN6Z3lzaHc/view?usp=sharing">InVRasion (Working
                Title)</a>
            is a work
            in progress virtual reality game for the HTC VIVE. It is an asynchronous multiplayer game in which a single
            VR
            player competes against up to four other players who use co-operative splitscreen. The VR player plays as a
            giant,
            city destroying monster, while the other players play as soldiers who attempt to defeat the monster before
            it
            destroys an objective. InVRasion has been in development since January of 2017 as a Senior Project for my
            degree
            in Computer Science at Cal Poly Pomona. After receiving academic credit for InVRasion, development has
            continued
            as a hobby since March of 2017. Created using Unity3D Game Engine and C#.

        <h3>Invisible Heroes</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-jDV3yzqTzuei1zTFFzbzU2M28/view?usp=sharing">Invisible Heroes</a>
            is my
            first Unity programming
            project. It is a simple game that requires the player to locate an artifact on a procedurally generated
            map.
            There is a readme within the linked file that includes more details.

        <h2>3D</h2>
        <p>
            I've been studying 3D as a hobby of mine for roughly a couple years, and I've even hosted a few Blender
            workshops for the <a href="http://www.cppgamedev.com/">Cal Poly Game Development and Design Club</a>
            . My recent works include the
            following:

            <br><br>
            - <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-jDV3yzqTzuSE9QTUcweC1lUTg?usp=sharing">de_nuke (WIP)</a>
            <br>This is a remake of the map de_nuke from Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. It is for the Virtual
            Reality game
            Pavlov VR, and is using a BSP-Blockout(Unreal) to Blender workflow.

            <br>
            - <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-jDV3yzqTzuMHE1TzhrM0k0NUU?usp=sharing">Interior Lounge
                ArchVis
                (WIP)</a>
            <br>This is an architectural visualization project for a lounge in Talinn, Estonia. It's currently a WIP
            and is incomplete
            because I am awaiting further details from the lead designer.

            <br>

            <br>
            - <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-jDV3yzqTzuVnpON00zVkFoNHM?usp=sharing">InVRasion</a>
            I did all of the 3D graphics for my InVRasion project. The graphics are still placeholder, because my
            primary focus thus far has been the programming of the various features involved in making the game fun.

            Video and Motion Graphics
        </h2>

        <p>
            I have After Effects, Premiere, and other Adobe Software experience, as evident via this
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjzLYgVMxBM&list=PLa2ERxwX1Sb75qZqmjDAIpn1hKLTyOytL">playlist</a>
            of my past work. These are older works, and though I have gained more experience, I have not made any more
            motion-graphics because I have been focusing on developing my 3D skills.
